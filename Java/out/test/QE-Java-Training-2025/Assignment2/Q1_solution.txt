1. What is the difference between a String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in Java?

Solution -

1. String :
it is immutable,
it is thread safe,
it is stored in string pool

2. StringBuilder:
it is mutable,
it is not thread safe,
supports only single-thread use,
relatively faster than StringBuffer

3. StringBuffer :
it is mutable,
it supports multi-thread use,
relatively slower than StringBuilder
