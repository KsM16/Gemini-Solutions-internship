Q10. Two interfaces A and B have a method with the same signature. What
happens if a class implements both?
interface A {
void show();
}
interface B {
void show();
}
class C implements A, B {
public void show() {
System.out.println("Implemented");
}
}

Solution -
it will compile both have same signatures so it will not cause any problem
but it was default method that it cause diamond problem
