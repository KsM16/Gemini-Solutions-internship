Q7. Youâ€™re creating a User class for an e-commerce app. One developer makes the
password field public. Another modifies it directly elsewhere. Why is this a
problem? How can you prevent such misuse?

Solution -
It is a problem because it compromises the security of the app, as in this way
anyone can change the access the password

we can make the fields private to prevent this
