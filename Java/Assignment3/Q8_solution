Q8. Consider a scenario where multiple users are updating a shared bank account balance concurrently.

· What are the potential issues?

· How can they be avoided?


Solution -
When multiple users try to update single field then -
1. Race conditions - when two threads try to read and update at the same time it can give unexpected values
2. Data inconsistency - intermediate states are visible resulting in inconsistencies like negative balance,etc.
3. Error in Updates - fields can be overwritten in a haphazard fashion

How to Avoid :
1. Use synchronization keyword
2. Use Locks
3.  Use Thread-safe Data Structures like ConcurrentHashMap
