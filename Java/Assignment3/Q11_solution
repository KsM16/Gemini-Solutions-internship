Q11. Youâ€™re working on a system that processes large JSON files.
How can you read such files efficiently in Java?
What patterns or classes would you use

Solution -
We can use a streaming parser that reads the file token-by-token.
The most popular and robust library for this in Java is Jackson.
Its Streaming API, specifically the JsonParser class, is perfect for this task.
Also we use Google's Gson library offers a similar JsonReader class that works on the same token-by-token principle.
