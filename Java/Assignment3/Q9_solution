Q9. Java provides both sequential and parallel ways to process collections.

· When should you consider using parallel processing?

· What precautions must be taken?

Solution -
We can use Parallel processing when we are dealing with Large data sets,
CPU-Intensive tasks or independent operations

Precautions -
Avoid shared mutable state inside the stream operations.
Parallel streams may not maintain the encounter order so that we can use .forEachOrdered()
Avoid nested parallel streams, which can create excessive thread usage and degrade performance
